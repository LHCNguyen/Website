            <i>Listening</i>
        </h2>
        <span>
                <p>The TOEIC Listening segment is <i><ins>45 minutes</ins></i> long and is composed of <i><ins>100 multiple choice questions</ins></i>.The listening segment has a low score of 5 points and a high score of 495 points. TOEIC listening scores can be mapped to the CEFR levels form A1 to C1, but not to level C2. This section cannot be taken without also taking the TOEIC Reading section during the same test session.</p>
                <ul><h3>Test Structure</h3></ul>
                <span>
                    <p>
                    The <b>TOEIC Listening</b> test is made up of 4 parts. Most students find the first part easier than the last part:<br><br>
                    <li><b>Part 1</b> of the TOEIC listening test asks students to match 6 recorded descriptions of images to the 6 images they describe. This segment lasts about 10 minutes. The images are printed in your test booklet but the descriptions are not. They are only recorded.<br><br></li>
                    <b>Part 2</b> of the TOEIC listening test asks students to listen to very short questions or statements and choose an appropriate answer or response for each one. There are 25 recordings and 25 questions in this part. The questions and possible answers are not printed in your test booklet. They are only recorded.<br><br>
                    <b>Part 3</b> of the TOEIC listening test asks students to listen to 13 dialogs and answer 3 questions about each one for a total of 39 questions. Both the dialogs and the questions about the dialogs are recorded. The questions are also printed in your test booklet, along with the 4 possible answers. You will have about 8 seconds to choose your answer before the next dialog question is asked.<br><br>                  
                    <b>Part 4</b> of the TOEIC listening test asks students to listen to 10 short monologs (single speaker) and answer 3 questions about each one. This is again a total of 30 questions. As in part 3, the questions are both recorded and printed in your test booklet. The monologs are only recorded. The 4 possible answers to each question are only printed in your test booklet.<br>
                    </p>
                </span>
                <ul><h3>Strategy</h3></ul>
                <span>
                    <p>
                        In all parts of the TOEIC listening test, the recordings are played only once. Once started, the recording will be played straight through, without pauses or repeats. Because of this imposed rhythm, it’s important to listen carefully to each recording, pick the best answer you can, then move on. Do not get stuck thinking about a previous question and miss the next recording.<br><br>
                        You will not be allowed to take any notes during the listening test. Blank answers on the TOEIC listening test are counted as incorrect answers, so it is always better to guess when you are not sure of the answer. Recordings on the TOEIC listening test can be with American, British, Canadian, or Australian accents.

            <i>Reading</i>
        </h2>
        <span>
            <p>The TOEIC reading comprehension test is the second half of the TOEIC Listening & Reading Test. The TOEIC reading segment is 75 minutes long (longer than listening test), and is composed of 100 multiple choice questions (the same number as the listening test). This segment has a low score of 5 points and a high score of 495 points. Because this is the second half of the test, it is crucial to stay concentrated.<br></p>
            <ul><h3>Test Structure</h3></ul>
            <span>
                <p>
                    Like the listening test, the TOEIC reading test is made up of 3 parts. Most students find the second part to be the easiest, but you can complete the 3 parts in any order you choose and allocate your time in any way you wish:<br><br>
                    Part 1 of the TOEIC reading test asks students to fill in the blanks in 30 incomplete sentences. The sentences are printed in your test booklet along with 4 possible ways to complete each sentence. Many TOEIC preparation specialists recommend going quickly through part 1 of the TOEIC reading test to answer those questions which seem simple to you, then come back to the ones you skipped to reflect more fully on the answers.<br><br>
                    Part 2 of the TOEIC reading test is made up of 4 texts in each of which 4 words are missing. For each missing word, you will have 4 choices of words to fill in that blank. This makes a total of 16 questions in part 2. Many students find this part the easiest of the four parts of the TOEIC reading test.<br><br>
                    Part 3 of the TOEIC reading test has two sub-sections. The first asks students to answer 29 reading comprehension questions. You will read 10 texts and answer 2 to 4 questions about each one. Again, each question has 4 possible answers of which you must choose 1. Many students find this part difficult because the texts can be relatively long. The ability to read and understand quickly is essential to success in this part of the TOEIC reading test. Remember that you can read the questions and answers first before reading the text in order to look for the answers as you read.<br><br>
                    In the second sub-section, you are given sets of two texts to read followed by 5 questions which refer to both texts. This sub-section of the TOEIC reading test is made up of 10 texts (5 pairs) with 5 questions about each pair, for a total of 25 questions.<br><br>
                </p>
            </span>
        </span>
        <ul><h3>Strategy</h3></ul>
        <span>
            <p>
                In all parts of the TOEIC reading test, it is essential not to waste time. Blank answers on the TOEIC reading test are counted as incorrect answers, so it is always better to guess, even if you are not sure of the answer. You might be lucky and get the answer right. As with any multiple-choice test, if you can eliminate 1 or 2 answers that you are certain are incorrect, you improve your chances of guessing correctly from the remaining answers.

        <h2>
            <i>Writing</i>
        </h2>
        <span>
            <p>The TOEIC writing test is the second half of the TOEIC Speaking & Writing Test. The TOEIC writing test is 1 hour long and is composed of 8 writing prompts. The writing segment has a low score of 0 points and a high score of 200 points. The TOEIC writing test cannot be taken without also taking the TOEIC speaking test during the same test session.<br><br>
                You take the TOEIC writing assessment on a computer, not on paper. You will read the prompts, then you must type your answer. Your answers are saved and transmitted to ETS for scoring. Your TOEIC writing score will be based on how precisely and accurately you use written English to communicate.<br></p>
            <ul><h3>Test Structure</h3></ul> 
            <span>
                <p>
                    The TOEIC writing test is made up of 3 parts which you must complete in order:<br><br>
                    Part 1 of the TOEIC writing test asks students to look at a picture and then write a sentence based on that picture that uses two words or phrases supplied by the TOEIC test makers. There are 5 pictures, each with 2 words supplied. You have 8 minutes to write all 5 sentences and can move forward and backward through this part of the TOEIC writing section during those 8 minutes. You get a score between 0 and 3 on each sentence based on grammatical accuracy and usage of the supplied words. This is questions 1 to 5.<br><br>
                    Part 2 of the TOEIC writing test gives students an e-mail and they must write a response. There are two tasks of this type and you will have 10 minutes for each one. The instructions will ask you’re your response meet certain criteria, for example, it might tell you to you ask at least two questions. It is important to read and follow those instructions. You cannot go back to the first writing task once you have moved on to the second one. Your scores will be on a scale of 0 to 4 for each question, and will be based not only on the quality of your English writing but also on the organization of the message. This is questions 6 and 7.<br><br>
                    Part 3 of the TOEIC writing test will ask you to write an opinion essay on a supplied topic. The topic does not require any specialized knowledge. You have 30 minutes to prepare, write, and revise your essay. Your score on the essay is on a scale of 0 to 5 based on the clarity of your argument, your English grammar and vocabulary, and the structure of your essay. This is question 8.<br><br>
                </p>
            </span>  
       </span>
       <ul><h3>Strategy</h3></ul>
       <span>
            <p>
                If you do not answer one of the questions on the TOEIC writing section or if you answer in your own language, it is counted as a zero, so it is always better to write something in English, even if you are not sure of the answer or your answer may be incomplete. You might still manage to get a point or two. Remember that you will need to be able to type your answers in English on the TOEIC writing test, so learning to type quickly on an QWERTY keyboard is important to avoid wasting time.<br><br>

            <i>Speaking</i>
        </h2>
        <span>
            <p>The TOEIC speaking test is the first half of the TOEIC Speaking & Writing Test. The TOEIC speaking test is 20 minutes long and is composed of 11 speaking prompts. The speaking segment has a low score of 0 points and a high score of 200 points. The TOEIC speaking test can be taken with or without the TOEIC writing test during the same test session. The TOEIC Listening & Reading test is separate and can be taken during the same test session, during a different test session, or not at all.<br><br>
                You take the TOEIC speaking assessment on a computer, not with a person. You will read or hear the prompts, then you must record your answer. Your recordings are saved and transmitted for scoring by ETS. Your TOEIC speaking score will be based on how well you demonstrate English fluency and accuracy in response to the prompts.</p>
            <ul><h3>Test Structure</h3></ul>
            <span>
                <p>
                    The TOEIC speaking test is made up of 6 question types in a fixed order. You are required to do the speaking test in order from 1 to 6 and you cannot stop the test or return to a question once you have finished it:<br><br>
                    Part 1 of the TOEIC speaking test asks students to read two texts. You will see each text written and you must read it aloud. You have 45 seconds to prepare and then 45 seconds to read each text. You get a score between 0 and 3 on each text you read based on your pronunciation, intonation, and stress. This is questions 1 and 2.<br><br>
                    Part 2 of the TOEIC speaking test shows you a picture which you must describe aloud. You have 30 seconds to prepare and then 45 seconds to describe the picture in detail. You will receive a score between 0 and 3 for this speaking task based on your pronunciation, intonation, and stress, but also your English grammar and vocabulary. This is question 3.<br><br>
                    Part 3 of the TOEIC speaking test asks students to answer 3 questions of an everyday nature. For example “Is there somewhere you go regularly on holiday?” You will have 15 seconds for each of the first two questions and 30 seconds for the third question. You do not have any preparation time. Your score on each of your answers is again on a scale of 0 to 3. This is questions 4, 5, and 6.<br><br>
                    Part 4 of the TOEIC speaking test is similar to part 3 except that in part 4 the student is given some background information and must answer 3 questions about it. For example, you might see a poster for an event and be asked when the event takes place or who will be speaking. The background information stays visible while you are answering the questions. You will have 30 seconds to read the background information, then 15 seconds each to answer the first two questions and 30 seconds to answer the final question. Your score on each question is on a scale of 0 to 3. This is questions 7, 8, and 9.<br><br>
                    Part 5 of the TOEIC speaking test asks you to listen to a recorded message that explains a problem and then propose a solution to the problem. After the recording that tells you the problem ends, you have 30 seconds to prepare your answer and then 60 seconds to speak and explain your solution. It is important that you make it clear that you have fully understood the problem as you are proposing your solution. Your score on this speaking section is on a scale of 0 to 5. This is question 10.<br><br>
                    Part 6 of the TOEIC speaking test asks you to listen to a short recording about a familiar topic and then express your opinion about that topic. You have 15 seconds to prepare your response and 60 seconds to speak. Your score on this speaking prompt is also on a scale of 0 to 5. This is question 11.<br><br>

                If you do not answer one of the questions on the TOEIC speaking section or if you answer in your own language, it is counted as a zero, so it is always better to say something in English, even if you are not sure of the answer or your answer may be incomplete. You might still manage to get a point or two. Remember to speak as calmly and clearly as you can and to answer each question completely. The person who will grade your TOEIC speaking test is not in the room with you, so gestures and facial expressions can’t help to explain your meaning.<br><br>
